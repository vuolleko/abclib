# ABClib
A library for approximate Bayesian computation. Includes also implementations of various auxiliary algorithms and various test cases. 

Implemented as a school project in Python and Cython.

Implementation includes:
* Basic likelihood-free rejection sampler ABC
* Markov chain Monte Carlo ABC
* Sequential Monte Carlo ABC
* The Classifier ABC framework
* Gaussian process
* The Bayesian Optimization for Likelihood-free Inference (BOLFI) framework
* Conjugate gradient
* DIRECT
* L-BFGS-B
* Merge sort
* Cholesky decomposition
* Solving of linear equations
* Matrix determinant
